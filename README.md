# CppSyntaxPane

CppSyntaxPane is a stripped down version of [JSyntaxPane](https://github.com/nordfalk/jsyntaxpane) I created for use in my [ATTiiny10IDE](https://github.com/wholder/ATTiny10IDE) project that only supports the CPP programming language.  The code has also been extensively modified to remove as much code not needed for CPP as possible.  In addition, the dynamic configuration feature based on Properties files has been removed and replaced with hard-coded variables where needed. You can run the class TestEditor to see CppSyntaxPane in action.

The original project JSyntaxPane can be found [on google-code](http://code.google.com/p/jsyntaxpane/). The version of JSyntaxcPane this code is based on is a fork from the 0.9.6 branch with [Hanns Holger Rutz](https://github.com/Sciss/SyntaxPane)'s work applied.
